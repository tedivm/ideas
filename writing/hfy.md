Right now /r/hfy and other writing communities keep hitting the same tropes over and over again- predator species, diplomats, total war, makes everything pets, super friends for life, self sacrifice for the great good, etc etc. Interesting outliers are like "sees the color red" (where humans went up against a species who couldn't see red, so they just painted everything) end up being far more interesting.

Since we don't have anything to compare to it's fair to assume that all traits humans have may be completely rare or potentially unique. If there's a universe where intelligent predator species are rare, maybe there's one where intelligent warm blooded ones are. Traits that don't have any example of convergent evolution (as in, traits which go back to a common ancenster) are a good avenue of research.
